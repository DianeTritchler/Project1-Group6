## Git to the Show!!!
 
* Git to the Show allows users to find music events near them, while allowing them to save their favorites, or navigate to a corresponding Ticketmaster page. 

## Description
* Git to the Show allows users from all over the country to search their local area for upcoming concerts, save them to a wish list, and redirect them to a Ticketmaster page. On the search box, users can enter a mile radius of their choosing, allowing them to not see concerts out of their area. For any user interested in learning about future events, there is a pop-up box allowing the users to subscribe to our website.

## Motivation
* We wanted an easier way to find local music events in our area.

## User Story
* With covid restrictions being lifted, people are looking forward to enjoying the things they have missed over the past year. One of those being concerts. Git to the Show allows these concert goers to look up upcoming concerts, and buy tickets from a corresponding Ticketmaster page. 

## Process
* The Ticketmaster API in coordination with Position Stack API. 
* Ticketmaster allows us to search for events based on location and radius
* The location required latitude & longitude
* Position Stack API allowed us convert  a traditional address to Latitude & Longitude.
* We used Bulma, VS Code studio
